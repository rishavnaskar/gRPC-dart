## Introduction

* Remote Procedure Call Framework by Google
* What does ‘g’ stand for? Check here
* Cross-platform, general purpose
* Uses Protocol Buffers
* Based around the idea of defining a service, specifying the methods
* Abstraction is easy (it’s a function call)
* Supported on a lot of languages

## Description

This repository is a demo written to show how to implement gRPC using Dart. We have created a simple Todo application to show creating and reading items, both individually and as a stream.

## Steps

* Make a .proto file
* Write necessary proto code in that file
* Generate dart code using protoc compiler and protoc plugin
* Can run dart code directly
* Can integrate with a Flutter application
